## Overview

Welcome to the "VoteChain" â€“ a pioneering platform utilizing ResilientDB and GraphQL, a cutting-edge blockchain technology, to revolutionize the landscape of electronic voting systems. Our primary focus is to ensure a secure and transparent voting process while emphasizing the significance of each voter's singular vote. VoteChain is designed to guarantee the permanence of votes, enabling every participant to cast a single vote per election.

## Tech Stack

1) **ResilientDB** - A cutting-edge blockchain technology chosen for its robustness and immutability, providing secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant data storage essential for our electronic voting system.
2) **GraphQL** - Utilised for efficient and versatile data querying, offering a streamlined interface to access blockchain based information. Implemented Fetch Transaction, Post Transaction and Send Request APIs using GraphQL.
3) **React.js** - It was utilized for building composable and interactive user interface within the VoteChain platform, facilitating the creation of modular components and seamless UI interactions.
4) **Material UI** - A responsive UI design library complementing React.js, ensured a consistent and visually appealing layout across various devices and screen sizes.
5) **Node.js** - It forms the foundational infrastructure for the VoteChain back end, managing server-side logic and acting as an intermediary between the user interface and ResilientDB blockchain
6) **ResVault** - VoteChain now uses ResVault for user authentication. Users will log in with their ResVault Wallet, and poll submissions will be linked to their account for enhanced protection and accountability.
7) **MongoDB** - The Custom Poll Creation and Discussion Panel features utilize MongoDB to securely store transaction-related data such as Poll Topics, Vote Options, and Messages. This data is organized into three collections: Poll, Vote, and Message Data, ensuring efficient management and retrieval of information.
